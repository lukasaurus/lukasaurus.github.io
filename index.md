# Digital Technology Course - New Zealand Curriculum

Welcome to the Digital Technology course! This course is designed around the New Zealand Curriculum, fostering computational thinking and digital literacy skills.

## Year Level Overviews

### Year 7-8 (Levels 2-3)
At this level, students begin to explore the basics of digital technologies. They will engage with concepts such as:
*   **Computational Thinking:** Understanding how to break down problems, identify patterns, and create step-by-step instructions (algorithms).
*   **Designing and Developing Digital Outcomes:** Creating simple digital solutions, like basic animations or interactive stories, using visual programming languages.
*   **Digital Citizenship:** Learning about online safety, privacy, and responsible use of digital tools.

### Year 9-10 (Levels 4-5)
Building on the foundational skills, students at this level delve deeper into digital concepts and practices:
*   **Computational Thinking:** Applying more complex algorithms, understanding data representation, and exploring abstraction.
*   **Designing and Developing Digital Outcomes:** Developing more sophisticated digital solutions, potentially involving text-based programming, web development basics, or app design.
*   **Digital Media:** Exploring the creation and manipulation of digital media, including graphics, audio, and video.
*   **Digital Technologies in Society:** Examining the impact of digital technologies on society, culture, and the environment.

### Year 11-13 (Levels 6-8)
In the senior years, students specialize and refine their digital technology skills, preparing for further study or careers. Topics may include:
*   **Advanced Programming:** Working with various programming paradigms and languages to create complex software solutions.
*   **Data Science and Analytics:** Understanding data collection, analysis, and visualization.
*   **Network and Cybersecurity:** Exploring network principles, security threats, and protective measures.
